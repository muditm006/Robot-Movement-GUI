The objective of this project is to create a program that allows the user to control the movement of the robot through a GUI on their device. The movements will be forward, backward, left, and right. Additionally, it will have parameters to control the robot’s movements. The program will consist of a ‘robot’ class with an init function that connects the motor pins to the h bridge for power. The time and speed at which each motor runs will be able to be regulated through each function. The parameter for the time the robot moves forward and the angle for turns can be regulated within the GUI. The program will be written in Python. The code contains two libraries; the “tkinter” and “requests” library. Both libraries are native to python.
